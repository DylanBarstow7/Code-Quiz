# 04 Code-Quiz

## Your Task

Week four homework.

This weeks homework required us to create a quiz application using a provided mock-up.  There were a few criteria for acceptance. The quiz must begin with a start button.  It must have a timer ticking down with a limited duration.  Time must be added or lost depending on a correct vs incorrect answer to a question. The quiz ends either by answering all questions or the timer running out. After the game is over there is a leaderboard to add your name to.
